## Analysis pipeline for the original taxonomic analysis for endometrial data 

## Original dataset is from this article published previously in the Pelzer lab

Sequence clustering and operational taxonomic unit (OTU) selection was performed using a modified version of CD-HIT-OTU-454 which does not remove singleton clusters (29). Taxonomy was assigned to representative sequences by comparison to the latest build of the Greengenes database (https://greengenes.secondgenome.com/) using BLAST (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi), and OTU tables were constructed from the output using a custom Perl script(30).

## The CD-HIT-OTU script is written in python and a copy can be found within this folder. The original script was written by Weizhong Li and was altered to change the variable $cutoff to the number 1 to include singletons (as shown in the line of code below). 
        $str = "$script_dir/clstr_select_rep.pl size 1 999999999 < $t1.nr2nd-all.clstr > $t1-pri-rep.ids";

## The 1 after size is the change - it was originally a variable called $cutoff that is provided by an earlier step in the process as a lower bound for removing small clusters.

## The taxonomic analysis was completed by assigning representative sequences  to the latest build of the Greengenes database (https://greengenes.secondgenome.com/) by comparison using BLAST (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi), and OTU tables were constructed from the output using a custom Perl script. 

## The blast script is a sh script included below and attached in the folder.
#blast command to make database from 97_otus file
makeblastdb -in 97_otus.fasta -dbtype nucl
#run blastn to the 97 percent OTUs, exclude at 10E-5, take top hit
blastn -db 97_otus.fasta -query seqs.fna -outfmt 6 -num_alignments 1 -evalue .00001 -out blastn_97.out

## Taxonomy for each sequence was identified using a parser script in Python as attached in this directory.
#run parser.py
python parser.py blastn_97.out blastn_97_with_tax.out
